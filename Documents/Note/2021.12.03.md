Discussion#1 

1.  We do not need to implement the person/non-person already
2.  My task is to improve and to improve it I need a lot of data  
3.  Change some setting in the algorithm
4.  MLP or CNN training need a lot of labeled data, To produce  the data, we need to labeled data
5.  Sensor can detect from 2m - 6m, (cone area)
6.  4 scenaraios 
    1. empty -> light no.1 ON   light no.2 OFF
    2. empty -> light no.1 OFF  light no.2 ON
    3. person -> light no.1 ON  light no.2 OFF
    4. person -> light no.1 OFF  light no.2 ON

7.  Get labeled, FFT, ADC --> Empty/Occupied Folder 
8.  1 Measurements/s probably 1TB HDD should be enough -->  100, 000 measurements
9.  1 Measurement -> 80 kB 
10. The transfer should be automatically
11. Ask Mr.Umansky about Computer, Webcam, WIFI, RP
12.
