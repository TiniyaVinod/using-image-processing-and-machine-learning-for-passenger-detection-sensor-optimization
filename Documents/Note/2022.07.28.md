## Project Module Node 2022.07.29 (Mitt)

1.  Process line by line between files from ultrasonic and files from person-detection program.
2.  Remove 10 second of data after the starting time and before the ending time to avoid uncertainty.
3.  Data label from person-detection program must be correct.
4.  In order to verify 3., Confusion matrix must be created.
5.  Synchronise time between Red Piataya and PC --> if not possible, find the offset and do the postprocess to shift results to match time.
6.  If offset cannot be found, make sure to collect the same label for data.
7.  Every 1 second (or 10 measurements) --> generate 1 measurement file from Red Pitaya. (Post process)
8.  Report --> Exam office within 1 Aug
9.  Improvement + Report --> Prof. Pech within the week after.
10. Report format --> IEEE without acknowledgement
11. Folders to contain data --> person/no person/uncertain
12. Data must be truly clean.
